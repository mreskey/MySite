        “Mark was selected for the Navy’s highly competitive Seaman to Admiral (STA)-21 program in early-2015, distinguishing himself as one of only 50 selectees out of over 400 applicants Navy-wide. In my 20+ years of experience as a Naval Officer,
        I have always been tremendously impressed with the superior job performance and leadership abilities displayed by STA-21 program graduates. Mark is the best of that distinguished group of Sailors. As his college professor, in addition to his
        superior officer, I also had the opportunity to observe Mark in an academic environment. His class contributions were always insightful and his ability to comprehend complex ethical models and apply them to ‘real world’ scenarios displayed a
        maturity and level of understanding well above that of his fellow classmates. I have no doubt that Mark Eskey will succeed in achieving his future goals. I would proudly serve with him in our Navy, but unfortunately, his promising military
        career has been curtailed by medical issues. The Navy’s loss could turn out to be everyone else’s gain.”

        “Officer Candidate Eskey is one of the few that has exhibited the highest degree of integrity, judgement and strength of character. I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing his academic and professional growth as a member of the NROTC at University of South Carolina. As an officer candidate with prior enlisted experience he has stepped up to the plate to go above and beyond his assigned responsibilities, setting a positive example for all to emulate. He has a proven track record of high performance resulting in a successful career in the Navy. His intellectual curiosity and love of learning made him an ideal candidate for our rigorous program. Eskey’s exceptional professionalism, unrelenting perseverance and loyal devotion will make him an irreplaceable asset to any future company he may join. I stand behind him and give my strongest recommendation and have no doubt that he will exceed your expectations.”
